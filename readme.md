=== ZERO'S ADVENTURES ===
Zero's Adventures - help little Zero reach his home through dangerous mazes! But be aware of the dangeorus creatures which live there!

This is the game "Zero The Game" I made previously in C# with the XNA library. Now I am going to rewrite it under C++ with SFML. Thus the game will be run as a standalone (portable) program (installing the game might be added later).
